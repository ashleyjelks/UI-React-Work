Restless Bandit's UI exercise
=============================

Welcome! This exercise is designed to let you show us your skills with a typical front-end task.

It should take around 2 hours.

## The task

We've decided to explore a card-based layout for displaying candidates. Restless Bandit's algorithm has found and graded some hypothetical candidates, and our designer has created a mockup of how the layout should look (`card-layout.png` at the top level of this repo).

We're using React, and we've got the project set up and ready to go. Your task is to build the UI shown in the mockup.

**What we're looking for:**
- Accurate translation of the design
- Tests for your components
- Clean, consistent code style

**Optional extensions:**
- Make the page responsive
- Add search bar functionality - update the candidates as you type
- Do something else cool - it can be anything you like!

Feel free to change anything and add any libraries you want (just be sure to `npm install --save` them).

When you're done, check out the [submission instructions](#submitting).

Good luck!

## Installing

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed (at least v4, preferably v6)
2. In the project directory, run `npm install`

## Running

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Submitting

1. `git format-patch master --stdout > your-name.patch`.
    Or, if you worked straight off of master, use the commit sha preceding
    your work.
2. Email the patch to [](mailto:).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
